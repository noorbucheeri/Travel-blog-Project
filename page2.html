   <h5><strong>Personal Thoughts:</strong></h5>
   <p>London has been my favorite Christmas destination a couple of years ago. The lights, the decoration and festive spirits have all inspired me to go there. However, like most european countries, the weather is freezing cold.
      London has now become a very crowded city, full of tourists in any season. The most interesting thing in London is, ofcourse, Shopping! Shopping in london is a must and I personally recommend places like Oxford street, Harrods, Bicester village and Carnaby Street.
      During the festive season, the winter wonderland is a festival/carnival located in the hyde park is a magical place to have fun by playing games, eating and have a walkabout. London is also known for its road markets. I personally like the “Portobello Market” which is on Saturdays in Portobello street. This market is full of vintage stores, antiques and food. For tourists visiting London for the first time, I would recommend taking the Tour City bus which tours around the city for the most famous tourist destinations such as The Big Ben, London Eye and The Madame Tussauds. Transporting in London is easy as you can take the undergrounds or the famous London buses which are not expensive at all.
      An important tip: Prepare yourself with thermal and warm clothes if visiting in the winter season to prevent sickness and illness. </p>

            <li> One of the most bike-friendly cities</li>

            <li>Known for their cheese "Gouda"</li>
          </ul>

          <h5><strong>Personal Thoughts:</strong></h5>
          <p>Amsterdam had different vibes than any other countries I have visited formerly. 
            I was personally shocked by the amount of cyclists in the city which is an absolute tourist activity when visiting the country. 
            I personally rented a bicycle through the hotel. However, there are several different locations to rent from. The most enjoyable time was when I visited Giethoorn. 
            This place is spectacular as shown from the picture I captured. I would definitely recommend this place for a visit. 
            It was extremely easy as the transports were planned and uncomplicated using a public transport bus. 
            The food there was extra-ordinary. I loved their street food which included fries and waffles which I genuinely recommend. 
            For shopping and relaxation, I would recommend Dam Square as it was averagely priced and had most coffee shops. 
            Zandaam is also a beautiful, old and historic city where the 18th and 19th century comes back to life. 
            Zandaam is known for its bakery museum, windmills and workshops located at the Zaan river bank.</p>

             <h5><strong>Key facts about Istanbul:</strong></h5>
              <ul>
              <li>The curreny used around is Turkish Lira, and is commonly used between Europe and Asia.</li>
              <li>Turkey is very much known for growing Hazelnuts and is responsible for a large percentage of exports worldwide</li>

              <li>There are more than 30 languages spoken in Turkey</li>
            </ul>

            <h5><strong>Personal Thoughts:</strong></h5>
            <p>Throughout my journey in Turkey, i have experienced a lot of different encounters that i never expected to happen,
              such as struggling to communicate with local people all the way to facing a massive crowds problems.
              And although there were plenty of things to enjoy, most promenintly Estiqlal Road which is widely known as 
              the top place to shop in Turkey, where i really enjoyed the different varitites of traditional and international
              shops. And also the amazing experience of crossing between two continents on a boat which is a must do activity.
              Added to that, the wonderful Kadikoy which was an entire experience on its own. Not to mention the top mall
              that i visited which was Kanyon, where i really enjoyed the stores offered and the bargains, while also 
              enjoying the food from Nusret which is a very delicious restaurant that i recommend you visit.
              Apart from that, my experience with Turkey was a mixed one, where although i really enjoyed these places, the local people remained
              to be very informal and not friendly which made me uncomfortable at times, while also having many languages spoken and
              English not understood by everyone did not help and at times seemed un-welcoming, as well as how crowded the places become
              and  the extreme spikes in price ranges during holiday seasons which may make the experience a bit unviable.
              Although if you're considering other place from the city and off season visits, Bursa and some small cities located
              besides Istanbul where you can have a range of activites such as snowboarding etc. could also be a valuable experience.

                  <p>Sweden was one of the stops I visited from experiencing the Norwegian Cruise Line so my visiting time was limited and I did not spend much time there. The famous Vasa Museum was one of the attractions I recommend for the whole family to see. Its a museum of the ship that sank in Stockholm. The ship was then salvaged after 333 years. My other attraction was to Stockholm center, it was one of the most beautiful centers I have ever visited. It was filled with shopping brands, coffee shops and souvenir shops while the weather was beautiful.
                    Other unforgettable experience was eating the mouth-watering Swedish meatballs.

                     <h5><strong>Personal Thoughts:</strong></h5>
                     <p> The beautiful city with rows of colorful buildings by the canal. Starting from what was my first stop " Nyhavn “ a charming place with those famous colorful artistic buildings and nearby seafood restaurants that I would definitely recommend to try. One should especially visit “ Mama Rosa “ where they had delicious Salmon with their special sauce and a mouth watering lobster as well and let’s not forget the breathtaking view of the canal. Moving on to the capital region which was the center of the city, I wouldn't  recommend shopping in Denmark as it’s one of the Scandinavian countries and the prices were very high. Personally, I just chose specific importance things that are unique and I really liked. For tourist, don’t forget to ask for tax free that will save some of your money.
                         The capital of Denmark is Copenhagen. One of the key tourist destinations of Copenhagen is Tivoli Gardens. It goes without saying as one of the best gardens i have ever visited  in my entire life. It’s an amusement park, wonderful for a family day, the vibes, lights , the rides and everything out there was perfect. Let’s not forget to mention their food hall that had a diverse menu and a great atmosphere. One must try their signature pizza by a restaurant called “ La Baracca “ where I had their tasteful truffles pizza. The last location i’d recommend is Torvehallerne street food, it’s a local market that sells food, some traditional clothes and you can walk around and enjoy the vibes. To get the full experience of the market, one must try their cultural food which is Smørrebrød. It was nice for a one time thing but I don’t believe i’ll get it again.
                         One final thing,  I took a tour with Nova Fairy Tales , their service was pleasant, and their prices were very convenient  . It was a 3 hours cycling tour around the city and it was fantastic

                I was addicted to one of their traditonal dishes called "Machboos" which was basically rice with some seasoned spices and your choice of meat, chicken or shrimp. One of my favorite attractions was the kuwait towers
               , they were ranked among the tallest towers in the world and were functioning as water towers. From up there you can almost observe a clear view of the country.
                 Their traditional market was also a definite place to visit as it consisted of every single traditional items known in the country. This market included spices, food,  and souvenirs.
                 It also had traditional costumes to buy ready made or tailored. </p>
